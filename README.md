# ImgClassifier-Spring

What is it?
This is a Spring Application, of an image classification service for the discipline of software development project, in my graduation of Computer Science.

It's complete?
Well ... It works. The initial design envisaged the use of rgb histograms and segmentation of a dish, since originally the application would be to estimate the calorie of meals of the university restaurant. However, due to issues such as term, only one knn classifier is working, with ORB descriptors of the images.
Some classes such as, resizer and histogram have already been implemented and tested. But they are not being used because the segmentation has not been done.

Can i use as want?
Yeah. I don't care. And would love to see other features being implemented on it. Soon i'll die (humans have too short lives), and i'm not taking anything to the grave.
